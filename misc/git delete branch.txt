Executive Summary

$ git push origin --delete <branch_name>
$ git branch -d <branch_name>
Delete Local Branch

To delete the local branch use:

$ git branch -d branch_name
Note: The -d option is an alias for --delete, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch. You could also use -D, which is an alias for --delete --force, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status." [Source: man git-branch]

Delete Remote Branch [Updated on 1-Feb-2012]

As of Git v1.7.0, you can delete a remote branch using

$ git push origin --delete <branch_name>
which might be easier to remember than

$ git push origin :<branch_name>
which was added in Git v1.5.0 "to delete a remote branch or a tag."

Therefore, the version of Git you have installed will dictate whether you need to use the easier or harder syntax.
