/*
 * const variables in C shouwld be initialised with a const only, when it is in 
 * static or global scope. The compiler needs to know the initial value at compilation 
 * time.
 *
 * While const variables in function scope can be initialised with and  without a const 
 * as well.
 *
 * const means that the variable is not to be changed be the program, but may be 
 * changed by the system in memory
